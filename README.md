# Task_Scheduler-Java
This Java project implements a Task Scheduler that schedules a set of tasks with given durations, deadlines, and resource constraints while respecting task dependencies. The scheduling algorithm prioritizes tasks based on earliest deadline first and ensures that dependencies are satisfied.
**Features**
â€¢	Uses topological sorting (Kahn's Algorithm) to process tasks in the correct order.
â€¢	Uses a priority queue (earliest deadline first) for scheduling.
â€¢	Allocates resources efficiently to avoid overuse.
â€¢	Ensures that no task exceeds its deadline.
â€¢	Prints the scheduled start time, end time, and resource allocation for each task.
**Prerequisites**
Before running this project, ensure you have:
â€¢	Java JDK (8 or higher) installed â†’ Check using java -version
â€¢	Git installed (if cloning from GitHub)
**Installation & Setup**
ðŸ”¹ Method 1: Clone the Repository (Recommended)

3.	Run:
                     java Main
**Input Format**
The program takes:
1.	A list of tasks with the following attributes:
o	id: Task identifier (e.g., "A", "B").
o	duration: Time required to complete the task.
o	deadline: Maximum allowable time to complete the task.
o	resources: Number of resources needed for the task.
2.	A list of dependencies, specifying which task depends on another.
3.	The total number of available resources.
